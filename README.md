# Python Piscine for Data Science

## Preamble

This repo contains the 42 School Python "Piscine" (aka Bootcamp) for Data Science. These exercises are designed to help you understand the basics of Python and how to use it for data science.

Each exercise comes with its own tester (if applicable) and a `README.md` to help you understand the scope of the exercise, what I learned and my approach to solving them.

## Structure

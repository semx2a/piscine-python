#PISCINE PYTHON FOR DATASCIENCE - DAY 0

##PREAMBLE

This project is a python bootcamp.

To run each app, I choose to use dockerisation for its ease of use and to make sure the apps run well on any machine.
Each exercise comes with its own tester and a README to help you understand the scope of the exercise.

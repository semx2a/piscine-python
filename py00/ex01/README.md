# Exercise 01: Introduction to packages

## Instructions

Write a script that formats the dates this way, of course your date will not be mine
as in the example but it must be formatted the same.
Expected output:

```sh
$>python format_ft_time.py | cat -e
Seconds since January 1, 1970: 1,666,355,857.3622 or 1.67e+09 in scientific notation$
Oct 21 2022$
$>
```

## Libraries

The script will use the `datetime` library to format the date. The `datetime` library is a built-in Python library that allows you to work with dates and times.


## Usage

This program requires Python 3.10

```sh
python3.10 format_ft_time.py | cat -e
```

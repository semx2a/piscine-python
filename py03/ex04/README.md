# Exercise 04: ft_calculator_advanced

## Description

You must provide the following elements in your code:

- Write a calculator class
- It must be able to do the following calculations: dot product, addition, subtraction.
- Each method takes two vectors and returns None. They each print the result.
- We consider the vectors will always have identical sizes, so no error handling needed.
- Find a decorator that can help you use the methods of the calculator
class without instantiating the class.

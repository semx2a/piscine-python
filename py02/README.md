# 42 Python Piscine - Day 02

## Data Tables

Learn how to load, manipulate and display datatables.

## Instructions

- No code allowed in the global scope. Use functions instead.
- Each program must have its own main function and cannot be a simple script:

```python
def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Any uncaught exception will invalidate the exercice.
- You can use any built-in function if not explicitly prohibited by the exercise.
- All your functions must have a documentation `func.__doc__`
- Your code must comply with the `flake 8` standard.

For this module, we will use data from FREE SCHOOL MATERIALS FROM [GAPMINDER.ORG](gapminder.org), CC-BY LICENSE. Your are encouraged to have a look at the available data to train yourself to manipulate data or do data vision.

## Exercises

### [00 - Load my Dataset](https://github.com/semx2a/piscine-python/tree/main/py02/ex00)

Create a function `load` that will load the dataset `life_expectancy_years.csv`, write its dimension and return it.

### [01 - Draw my Country](https://github.com/semx2a/piscine-python/tree/main/py02/ex01)

Create a program that displays a line graph of the life expency of a country over the years.

### [02 - Compare my Country](https://github.com/semx2a/piscine-python/tree/main/py02/ex02)

Create a program that displays two line graphs, one for each country to compare their population growth projections.

### [03 - Draw my year](https://github.com/semx2a/piscine-python/tree/main/py02/ex03)

Create a program that displays a scatter plot that projects the life expency in relation to Gross Domestic Product for the year 1900.
